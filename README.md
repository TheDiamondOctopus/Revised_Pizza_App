This project is a simple pizza ordering web application that allows the user to place an order for a select number of pizzas and pay for them online. The user can choose delivery or carryout, and can enter their credit card information to pay for the pizza.

I have provided the files to run the project locally. This is a revised version of a project I oringally created for my CS601 (Web Dev) class. The revisions are entirely CSS related. I mostly wanted to clean up the interface and make it look nicer than the original. 

The original project was hosted at the following address using Github Pages:
